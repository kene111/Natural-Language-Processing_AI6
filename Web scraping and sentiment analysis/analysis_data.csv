Swan Oyster Depot,"After nearly 2.5 years of living less than 10 minutes walking distance from Swan Oyster Depot, I FINALLY made it to this iconic SF spot. I will say that we severely underestimated the wait time. We arrived at 1pm on Friday and waited for 1.5 hours. I probably will not be doing this again anytime soon, unless I'm waiting for their fresh uni (which they didn't have this time around, bummer). For two, we ordered: - dozen mixed oysters: 6 types, I liked these - smoked salmon: THEE best smoked salmon in SF, comparable to Russ & Daughters in NY which has amazing smoked salmon- smoked trout and smoked white fish: I preferred the salmon, but this was good as well - Sicilian sashimi: my first time having sashimi with olive oil, onions and capers. This was really good, my absolute favorite were the scallops which we ended up ordering more of. GET THE SCALLOPS! - Scallops: So buttery, get the Sicilian style over the ponzu style- octopus salad: I would pass on this Total with two glasses of wine came out to $156 which is pretty hefty for lunch. We waited a long time so might as well try everything and make it worthwhile, right? Swan's definitely a SF bucket list place, but for the price and wait it's not something I would do regularly."

ROOH,"There's been a new wave of contemporary Indian restaurants popping up in San Francisco over the past two years. To be honest, I hadn't tried any of them. I don't eat Indian food too often, and when I do I usually just go somewhere convenient, homey, and what friends tell me is authentic. But my bf's Indian roommate eats Indian food every single day (ok maybe sometimes he orders Thai curry lol), and ROOH has his definitive stamp of approval. So when we were planning a double date, roomie and roomie's gf suggested this place and it was perfect. Indian food is [obviously] very flavorful, but all the dishes we tried at ROOH had so many elevated dimensions of flavor that it was truly a culinary treat.We ordered:-DAHI PURI: Perfect opening to our meal. Delicate, flaky puri shells filled with avocado, tamarind, mint/cliantro chutney, and yogurt mousse. They were little bites of deliciousness.-MASALA JACKFRUIT TACO: I'm Southeast Asian, so I'm used to eating jackfruit in desserts and had no idea it can be used as a meat substitute. I was pleasantly surprised how the jackfruit wasn't diced but actually shredded and cooked to a meaty texture. Very cool to try!-TANDOORI SMOKED PORK RIBS: There ribs were so fall off the bone that all the meat fell off when I picked it up from the plate. I'm a pretty carnivorous eater, so I was happy when these arrived to our table. It was also fascinating to taste how a tandoori oven imparts a subtly different smokiness to meat. Definitely recommend if you're a meat lover like me.-ARTICHOKE AND FAVA DUMPLING: We wanted to try the paneer pinwheels but our waiter said they're pretty much the same as the butter chicken and recommended this instead. These were good but not a standout. Honestly one of those times that the waiter should've just let us order what we were going to order.-TRADITIONAL BUTTER CHICKEN: Probably the most luscious, tender chicken I've ever had in a curry. On saffron rice or dunked into with some garlic naan, the sauce was fantastic and the most gluttonous part of my dining experience. It was the most traditional dish of everything we'd tried, but it was still my favorite part.-KASHMIRI LAMB GUSHTABA: Spicy meatballs in a curry sauce. My friend told me about Kashmir-- the beautiful Himalayan region that's unfortunately become a conflict zone between India and Palestine. Perhaps too heavy for a Yelp review, but Kashmir has been in the news a lot these past few days and it's literally given me food for thought. I know it sounds dramatic, but it was a humbling, contemplative experience getting to eat this dish from a culture that's experienced so much turmoil. It's probably also why I had such a unique dining experience here.Other staples: Garlic naan, plain naan, avocado garlic raita, saffron rice. Yum, yum, yum, and yum.Needless to say, I had a lovely meal at ROOH. Best of all, it's made its case that Indian cuisine can be both comfort food as well as a culinary affair. Brb while I eat at all the other new Indian restaurants."

Very cool to try!-TANDOORI SMOKED PORK RIBS: There ribs were so fall off the bone that all the meat fell off when I picked it up from the plate. I'm a pretty carnivorous eater, so I was happy when these arrived to our table. It was also fascinating to taste how a tandoori oven imparts a subtly different smokiness to meat.

These were good but not a standout. Honestly one of those times that the waiter should've just let us order what we were going to order.-TRADITIONAL BUTTER CHICKEN: Probably the most luscious, tender chicken I've ever had in a curry. On saffron rice or dunked into with some garlic naan, the sauce was fantastic and the most gluttonous part of my dining experience. It was the most traditional dish of everything we'd tried, but it was still my favorite part.-KASHMIRI LAMB GUSHTABA: Spicy meatballs in a curry sauce. My friend told me about Kashmir-- the beautiful Himalayan region that's unfortunately become a conflict zone between India and Palestine. Perhaps too heavy for a Yelp review, but Kashmir has been in the news a lot these past few days and it's literally given me food for thought. I know it sounds dramatic, but it was a humbling, contemplative experience getting to eat this dish from a culture that's experienced so much turmoil. It's probably also why I had such a unique dining experience here.Other staples: Garlic naan, plain naan, avocado garlic raita, saffron rice.

ROOH,"There's been a new wave of contemporary Indian restaurants popping up in San Francisco over the past two years. To be honest, I hadn't tried any of them.

Very cool to try!-TANDOORI SMOKED PORK RIBS: There ribs were so fall off the bone that all the meat fell off when I picked it up from the plate. I'm a pretty carnivorous eater, so I was happy when these arrived to our table. It was also fascinating to taste how a tandoori oven imparts a subtly different smokiness to meat. Definitely recommend if you're a meat lover like me.-ARTICHOKE AND FAVA DUMPLING: We wanted to try the paneer pinwheels but our waiter said they're pretty much the same as the butter chicken and recommended this instead. These were good but not a standout. Honestly one of those times that the waiter should've just let us order what we were going to order.-TRADITIONAL BUTTER CHICKEN: Probably the most luscious, tender chicken I've ever had in a curry. On saffron rice or dunked into with some garlic naan, the sauce was fantastic and the most gluttonous part of my dining experience. It was the most traditional dish of everything we'd tried, but it was still my favorite part.-KASHMIRI LAMB GUSHTABA: Spicy meatballs in a curry sauce. My friend told me about Kashmir-- the beautiful Himalayan region that's unfortunately become a conflict zone between India and Palestine. Perhaps too heavy for a Yelp review, but Kashmir has been in the news a lot these past few days and it's literally given me food for thought. I know it sounds dramatic, but it was a humbling, contemplative experience getting to eat this dish from a culture that's experienced so much turmoil. It's probably also why I had such a unique dining experience here.Other staples: Garlic naan, plain naan, avocado garlic raita, saffron rice. Yum, yum, yum, and yum.Needless to say, I had a lovely meal at ROOH. Best of all, it's made its case that Indian cuisine can be both comfort food as well as a culinary affair. Brb while I eat at all the other new Indian restaurants."
Pizza Squared,"I've never had Detroit style pizza before! I'm usually not a fan of the crust or anything with too much dough but I must say I really did enjoy the slices I had here. The dough was nice and soft but the sides were crispy even as leftovers! (I took slices home because I couldn't finish it there)My friend and I tried:- Caramelized onion: surprisingly I liked this one a lot but maybe it's because of the caramelized onion since I normally love my pizza with meat!- Clams and bacon: this was pretty good but I wish I tasted more clams but for $6.75, I can't complain!- Pepperoni: it's not fair that i'm comparing it the Prince Street pizza in New York, but because I am, it's not as great but it's still really good crispy and curled up pepperoni! I wish it had a little more pepperoniSuper nice staff and I'm really happy about the pricing $6-$6.75 for pretty large rectangle slices. There's no seating but there's a small standing area for you to enjoy your pizza! I will definitely be back to try their other slices :)"

jū-ni,"My best omakase experience to date and a Michelin Star so well deserved! Make reservations in advance because seating is only limited to 12 people, 1 chef per 4 guests, which makes the dining experience so much more intimate and focused. We ate an 18 course omakase menu and every bite made my eyes close with satisfaction. Each nigiri is prepared right in front of you and I didn't think it was possible to taste fish the way I did that night. My favorite pieces of the night were the Copper River King Salmon, Ume Madai (Plum Snapper), Zuke Sake (White Soy Cured King Salmon), and Hon Maguro (Sustainable Bluefin Tuna). The homemade hojicha ice cream at the end was the perfect way to end the meal. Loved our time here and enjoyed every moment of it. Thank you so much for a wonderful meal!"

Corner Bakery Cafe,"Our office ordered lunch for us from Corner Bakery last week and I opted for the BBLT. Upon biting into it, I experienced one of the most delicious bacon I had ever tasted! It had perfectly crispy strips that were still very thick, yet not burnt like we tend to find with many other places. The bread was perfectly grilled and was definitely loaded full of the delicious bacon mentioned above! I savored every bite, down to the last crumb of bacon, which I greedily licked clean from the container.Seriously: BEST....BACON....EVER!Most of the complaints here seems to revolve around the service. And to be fair, I never stepped foot inside the establishment as our office admin picked up our orders for us. However from the food alone, this place is on my must order list!"

Empero Taste,I have been here several times for lunch and dinner... And the Empero Taste Restaurant isn't that bad of a place!!! Except for that one time which was my very 1st time with my family during the early Chinese New Year Dinner of February 2nd 2019... It was totally crowded the good thing was we called for a reservation for a table of 11!!! Only thing was it got so busy with a lot of people that were at their tables.. So our waitress took a while to bring the items that was ordered from the menu!!!But after that it calmed down for a little bit... If deciding to come here to eat here for the Chinese New Year my advice to you locals or out of towners call for reservation or other wise things can get crazy and you may end up waiting for a table for a very long time!!! The items that enjoy eating that was ordered from the menu from Empero Taste would be...Crispy Fried ChickenEgg Plant Clay PotHoney Walnut ShrimpSalt & Pepper Pork Spare Ribs Mixed Mushrooms Fired SeafoodMongolian BeefString Bean BeefThree Mushroom TofuI consider the Empero Taste as one my most favorite Chinese Restaurant to eat at in the San Francisco area!!!

Sasa,"Sushi has become a major hit in San Francisco, with a hand full of Michelin Star Omakases. I have tried it all. They are good but sometimes you just want good sushi but not the crazy price tag. fyi...good sushi is a little pricey, so complain all you want. If you want cheap sushi, fly to Japan or the other option... is you might get sick. Sasa was very good. It's not super expensive and it's affordable. Fish is expensive everywhere. I got the Grand Sushi Omakase: chef choice 10 piece includes a hand roll and miso soup for $42 dollars (lunch menu). I can eat a lot, therefore I shared a mystery box with my friend. It's the most Instagramable thing on the menu. So cute! The fish was fresh which is all you really need. Lightly seasoned, enough flavor. No need for extra wasabi and soy sauce. Presentation is great. I already made reservations to come back. Also they can be as good as Hinata (Hinata is higher end). Not as fancy but taste is there. Sasa is located on the second floor of the daiso plaza. Love the wooden modern decor. The staff was friendly as well. The owner was great."

Sasa,"Sushi has become a major hit in San Francisco, with a hand full of Michelin Star Omakases. I have tried it all. They are good but sometimes you just want good sushi but not the crazy price tag. fyi...good sushi is a little pricey, so complain all you want. If you want cheap sushi, fly to Japan or the other option... is you might get sick. Sasa was very good. It's not super expensive and it's affordable. Fish is expensive everywhere. I got the Grand Sushi Omakase: chef choice 10 piece includes a hand roll and miso soup for $42 dollars (lunch menu). I can eat a lot, therefore I shared a mystery box with my friend. It's the most Instagramable thing on the menu. So cute! The fish was fresh which is all you really need. Lightly seasoned, enough flavor. No need for extra wasabi and soy sauce.

Caffe Sapore,"One of local favoritesCaffe Sapore has been here for as long as I remember and it is one of the neighborhood cafes that is mostly frequented by locals. That is partly because it is one or two blocks removed from the main tourist traffic routes. I often stop there in the morning during weekends, so I can tell you that the coffee drinks are good and all things bagel are delicious! Over the years I must have tried most, if not all, of their Breakfast Bagels and Bagel Sandwiches and they all have been very good. They have outside seating on their store front along Lombard or Taylor, so depending on the weather or the time of the day, you could enjoy the fresh weather outside while sipping on your coffee. In most chilly mornings in San Francisco, my choice is to find a window seat and enjoy natural light while reading my book."

U :Dessert Story,"Husband: ""But you just had dessert.....You want to go to another place for even more dessert?""Me: 8} Even if you JUST HAD dessert, this place is absolutely worth a second pit stop. So far, I adore the tempting Korean-Japanese-Thai style dessert and beverage selections from here. Come in a group so you can try a bunch of different items! During my visit, I ordered the Pandan Crepe Cake with house made young coconut sauce on the side. By the way, this jizz sauce makes the cake; use all of it. I love how this cake and the accompanying sauce weren't cloyingly sweet. I also ordered an iced Matcha Latte, which was perfect! The organic matcha comes from Japan's Encha Uji Farm, so its gotta be legit. TL;DR: High-quality desserts that I strongly recommend. + Order whole crepe cakes at least 1 day in advance + Reservations recommended on weekends"

During my visit, I ordered the Pandan Crepe Cake with house made young coconut sauce on the side. By the way, this jizz sauce makes the cake; use all of it. I love how this cake and the accompanying sauce weren't cloyingly sweet. I also ordered an iced Matcha Latte, which was perfect! The organic matcha comes from Japan's Encha Uji Farm, so its gotta be legit. TL;DR: High-quality desserts that I strongly recommend. + Order whole crepe cakes at least 1 day in advance + Reservations recommended on weekends"

Mahar Yangon,"Mahar Yangon's cuisine reminds me of my family. It's the scent and taste of eating food that your mom would've cooked you as a child, but with that same tang that reminds you that the last time you talked to your family was a really, really long time ago.This place is an unassuming storefront along Mission St. in Daly City, just around Top of the Hill. The best parking lot is the one just a block over on Mission, where you pray that your emergency brakes don't fail because each parking space is like a hill in and of itself. On the day my friends and I came, it was a miraculously clear night amid what felt like nonstop showers and wind storms. The ants had gone marching one by one into Mahar Yangon, inhabiting the 5 millimeter-wide tops of the paneling in the dining room. Like them, we came seeking comfort and good food. After much hemming and hawing (none of us had ever eaten Burmese food before), we placed orders for the chicken biryani, palata stuffed with chicken, the kyay-oh noodle soup with pork and black sticky rice with vanilla ice cream.The chicken biryani differs from other South Asian biryani dishes I've had, but I prefer this rendition. There's a heavier flavoring of cinnamon that lends a nuttier and sweeter flavor to the chicken. The fragrant rice was much oilier than I was used to, so while it caught me off-guard, it went very well with the chicken. I regret to say I can't remember much of the noodle soup other than that it felt like a much lighter option, similar to home-cooked simple meat-and-veg soups.Our palata was the last thing to come out despite being billed as an appetizer. It seemed like other tables had the same problem with palatas coming out last, which could be the kitchen's lack of planning. I loved this, though, because it was the perfect, crispy dish to go with our super soft carbs and meat. The profile was pretty similar to that of the chicken biryani, but this had a stronger onion flavor.What you shouldn't skimp on, though, is the amazing dessert menu. I am so glad we bit the bullet on the sticky rice. Two scoops of rapidly melting vanilla ice cream meet gently heated sticky rice, which featured what I think was delicious coconut milk. There's also a couple squeezes of fudge on top, but forget about that: all your attention should be on the delicate interplay between the vanilla, coconut and sweet rice. Do NOT miss out on this.Unfortunately, I have to agree with other patrons and echo the assessment that it's absolutely freezing in there. It's not much colder dining here than it is in the walk-in freezer of your local Costco dairy and produce section. Bring a jacket or spend so much money eating here that they can buy a nice space heater. Most of the orders we saw were for takeout, and there appears to be the opportunity to order on Caviar or Grubhub, so really, you could enjoy tasty Burmese food without moving more than 10 feet from your couch."

I am so glad we bit the bullet on the sticky rice. Two scoops of rapidly melting vanilla ice cream meet gently heated sticky rice, which featured what I think was delicious coconut milk. There's also a couple squeezes of fudge on top, but forget about that: all your attention should be on the delicate interplay between the vanilla, coconut and sweet rice. Do NOT miss out on this.Unfortunately, I have to agree with other patrons and echo the assessment that it's absolutely freezing in there. It's not much colder dining here than it is in the walk-in freezer of your local Costco dairy and produce section. Bring a jacket or spend so much money eating here that they can buy a nice space heater. Most of the orders we saw were for takeout, and there appears to be the opportunity to order on Caviar or Grubhub, so really, you could enjoy tasty Burmese food without moving more than 10 feet from your couch."
Mahar Yangon,"Mahar Yangon's cuisine reminds me of my family. It's the scent and taste of eating food that your mom would've cooked you as a child, but with that same tang that reminds you that the last time you talked to your family was a really, really long time ago.This place is an unassuming storefront along Mission St. in Daly City, just around Top of the Hill. The best parking lot is the one just a block over on Mission, where you pray that your emergency brakes don't fail because each parking space is like a hill in and of itself. On the day my friends and I came, it was a miraculously clear night amid what felt like nonstop showers and wind storms. The ants had gone marching one by one into Mahar Yangon, inhabiting the 5 millimeter-wide tops of the paneling in the dining room. Like them, we came seeking comfort and good food. After much hemming and hawing (none of us had ever eaten Burmese food before), we placed orders for the chicken biryani, palata stuffed with chicken, the kyay-oh noodle soup with pork and black sticky rice with vanilla ice cream.The chicken biryani differs from other South Asian biryani dishes I've had, but I prefer this rendition. There's a heavier flavoring of cinnamon that lends a nuttier and sweeter flavor to the chicken. The fragrant rice was much oilier than I was used to, so while it caught me off-guard, it went very well with the chicken. I regret to say I can't remember much of the noodle soup other than that it felt like a much lighter option, similar to home-cooked simple meat-and-veg soups.Our palata was the last thing to come out despite being billed as an appetizer. It seemed like other tables had the same problem with palatas coming out last, which could be the kitchen's lack of planning.
